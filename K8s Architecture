------------**k8s architecture**

# Control plane (master node)
## api server - core component of k8s, accepts all incoming  reqs, exposes k8s to external world.
## etcd - key value store, cluster related infos.
## scheduler - scheduling pods or resources on k8s, receives info from api server & acts on it
## controller manager - ensures controllers like replica set are running
## cloud controller manager - like terraform

# Data plane (worker node)
## kubelet - creates pod, ensures pod is always running
## kube proxy - provides networking like Docker0, default load balancing
## container runtime - runs container inside pod
